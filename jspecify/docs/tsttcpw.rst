The Simplest(?) Thing That Could Possibly Work for subtyping
============================================================

**This is not “the jspecify spec.” This is an initial attempt to
formally specify only a subset of the rules we’ll need for a subset of
features we wish to cover. Additionally, it deviates from some of our
current working decisions in an effort to remain simple.**

.. _concept-references:

References to concepts defined by this spec
-------------------------------------------

When a rule in this spec refers to any concept that is defined in this
spec (for example, `substitution <#substitution>`__ or
`containment <#containment>`__), apply this spec’s definition (as
opposed to other definitions, such as the ones in the JLS).

Additionally, when a rule in this spec refers to a JLS rule that in turn
refers to a concept that is defined in this spec, likewise apply this
spec’s definition.

In particular, when a JLS rule refers to types, apply this spec’s
definition of `augmented types <#augmented-type>`__ (as oppposed to
`base
types <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__).

Additional nullness
-------------------

An additional nullness is one of 3 values:

-  ``UNION_NULL``
-  ``NO_CHANGE``
-  ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``

..

   The distinction among these 3 values is similar to the distinction
   among the Kotlin types ``Foo?``, ``Foo``, and ``Foo!``, respectively.

Augmented type
--------------

An augmented type consists of a `base
type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
and an `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ corresponding to
*each* of its `type
components <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.g7gl9fwq1tt5>`__.

   This differs from our current `glossary
   definition <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=id.367l48xhsikk>`__,
   which is written in terms of a “nullness” for each component, not an
   “additional nullness.” Still, the glossary’s concept of the
   “nullness” of a type is derivable from the type’s additional
   nullness. Notably, the glossary’s “nullable” type is our `least
   convenient world’s <#multiple-worlds>`__\ ’s `null-inclusive under
   every
   parameterization <#null-inclusive-under-every-parameterization>`__,
   and the glossary’s “non-nullable” type is our least convenient
   world’s `null-exclusive under every
   parameterization <#null-exclusive-under-every-parameterization>`__.

For our purposes, base types (and thus augmented types) include not just
class and interface types, array types, and type variables but also
intersection types and the null type. This is true even though the JLS
sometimes does not supply rules for intersection types and sometimes has
separate rules for the null type.

The goal of this spec is to define rules for augmented types compatible
with those that the JLS defines for base types.

   In almost all cases, this spec agrees with the JLS’s rules when
   specifying what *base* types appear in a piece of code. It makes an
   exception for `“Bound of an unbounded
   wildcard,” <#unbounded-wildcard>`__ for which it specifies a bound of
   ``Object`` that the JLS does not specify.

When this spec uses capital letters, they refer to augmented types
(unless otherwise noted). This is in contrast to the JLS, which
typically uses them to refer to base types.

When this spec refers to “the additional nullness of” a type ``T``, it
refers specifically to the additional nullness of the type component
that is the entire type ``T``, without reference to the additional
nullness of any other type components of ``T``.

   For example, the additional nullness of ``List<@Nullable Object>``
   would be ``NO_CHANGE`` (at least in a `null-aware
   context <#null-aware-context>`__), even though the additional
   nullness of its element type ``Object`` is ``UNION_NULL``.

Null-aware context
------------------

To determine whether a type usage appears in a null-aware context:

Look for an ``@org.jspecify.annotations.NullAware`` annotation on any of
the containing scopes surrounding the type usage.

Class members are contained by classes, which may be contained by other
class members or classes, and top-level classes are contained by
packages, which may be contained by modules.

   This concept of “containing scopes” is different from the concept of
   “containing types” described under `Containment <#containment>`__.

If an ``@org.jspecify.annotations.NullAware`` annotation exists on one
of these scopes, then the type usage is in a null-aware context.
Otherwise, it is not.

.. _augmented-type-of-usage:

Augmented type of a type usage in code
--------------------------------------

For most type usages in source code or bytecode on which jspecify
nullness annotations are structurally valid, this section defines how to
determine their `augmented types <#augmented-type>`__. Note, however,
that rules for specific cases below take precedence over the general
rule here.

Because the JLS already has rules for determining the `base
type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
for a type usage, this section covers only how to determine its
`additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__.

To determine the additional nullness, apply the following rules in
order. Once one condition is met, skip the remaining conditions.

-  If the type usage is annotated with
   ``@org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable``, its additional nullness is
   ``UNION_NULL``.
-  If the type usage appears in a `null-aware
   context <#null-aware-context>`__, its additional nullness is
   ``NO_CHANGE``.
-  Its additional nullness is ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.

.. _intersection-types:

Augmented type of an intersection type
--------------------------------------

   Technically speaking, the JLS does not define syntax for an
   intersection type. Instead, it defines a syntax for type parameters
   and casts that supports multiple types. Then the intersection type is
   derived from those. Intersection types can also arise from operations
   like `capture conversion <#capture-conversion>`__. See `JLS
   4.9 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.9>`__.

   One result of all this is that it’s never possible for a programmer
   to write an annotation “on an intersection type.”

This spec assigns an `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ to
each individual element of an intersection type, following our normal
rules for type usages. It also assigns an additional nullness to the
intersection type as a whole. The additional nullness of the type as a
whole is always ``NO_CHANGE``.

   This lets us provide, for every `base
   type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__,
   a rule for computing its `augmented type <#augmented-type>`__. But we
   require ``NO_CHANGE`` so as to avoid questions like whether “a
   ``UNION_NULL`` intersection type whose members are ``UNION_NULL``
   ``Foo`` and ``UNION_NULL`` ``Bar``” is a subtype of “a ``NO_CHANGE``
   intersection type with those same members.” Plus, it would be
   difficult for tools to output the additional nullness of an
   intersection type in a human-readable way.

..

   To avoid ever creating an intersection type with an additional
   nullness other than ``NO_CHANGE``, we define special handling for
   intersection types under `“Unioning an augmented type with an
   additional nullness.” <#unioning>`__

.. _unioning:

Unioning an augmented type with an additional nullness
------------------------------------------------------

Given an `augmented type <#augmented-type>`__ (which, again, includes an
`additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ for the type) and a
second additional nullness, we define a process to union the augmented
type with the second additional nullness:

First, based on the pair of additional nullnesses (the one from the
augmented type and the second additional nullness), compute a “desired
additional nullness.” Do so by applying the following rules in order.
Once one condition is met, skip the remaining conditions.

-  If either additional nullness is ``UNION_NULL``, the desired
   additional nullness is ``UNION_NULL``.
-  If either additional nullness is ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``, the
   desired additional nullness is ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.
-  The desired additional nullness is ``NO_CHANGE``.

Then, if the input augmented type is *not* an intersection type, the
output is the same as the input but with its additional nullness
replaced with the desired additional nullness.

Otherwise, the output is an intersection type. For every element ``Tᵢ``
of the input type, the output type has an element that is ``Tᵢ`` unioned
with the desired additional nullness.

   In this case, the desired additional nullness is always equal to the
   second additional nullness that was an input to this process. That’s
   because the additional nullness `of the intersection type
   itself <#intersection-types>`__ is defined to always be
   ``NO_CHANGE``.

.. _unbounded-wildcard:

Bound of an “unbounded” wildcard
--------------------------------

In source, an unbounded wildcard is written as ``<?>``. This section
does **not** apply to ``<? extends Object>``, even though that is often
equivalent to ``<?>``. See `JLS
4.5.1 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.5.1>`__.

In bytecode, such a wildcard is represented as a wildcard type with an
empty list of upper bounds and an empty list of lower bounds. This
section does **not** apply to a wildcard with any bounds in either list,
even a sole upper bound of ``Object``.

   For a wildcard with an explicit bound of ``Object`` (that is,
   ``<? extends Object>``, perhaps with an annotation on ``Object``),
   instead apply `the normal rules <#augmented-type-of-usage>`__ for the
   explicit bound type.

If an unbounded wildcard appears in a `null-aware
context <#null-aware-context>`__, then it has a single upper bound whose
`base
type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
is ``Object`` and whose `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__
is ``UNION_NULL``.

If an unbounded wildcard appears outside a null-aware context, then it
has a single upper bound whose base type is ``Object`` and whose
additional nullness is ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.

   In both cases, we specify a bound that does not exist in the source
   or bytecode, deviating from the JLS. Because the base type of the
   bound is ``Object``, this should produce no user-visible differences
   except to tools that implement jspecify nullness analysis.

Whenever a JLS rule refers specifically to ``<?>``, disregard it, and
instead apply the rules for ``<? extends T>``, where ``T`` has a base
type of ``Object`` and the additional nullness defined by this section.

.. _object-bounded-type-parameter:

Bound of an ``Object``-bounded type parameter
---------------------------------------------

In source, an ``Object``-bounded type parameter can be writen in either
of 2 ways:

-  ``<T>``
-  ``<T extends Object>`` with no jspecify nullness type annotations on
   the bound

See `JLS
4.4 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.4>`__.

In bytecode, ``<T>`` and ``<T extends Object>`` are both represented as
a type parameter with only a single upper bound, ``Object``, and no
jspecify nullness type annotations on the bound.

If an ``Object``-bounded type parameter appears in a `null-aware
context <#null-aware-context>`__, then its bound has a `base
type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
of ``Object`` and an `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ of
``NO_CHANGE``.

   Note that this gives ``<T>`` a different bound than ``<?>`` (though
   only in a null-aware context).

If an ``Object``-bounded type parameter appears outside a null-aware
context, then its bound has a base type of ``Object`` and an additional
nullness of ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.

   All these rules match the behavior of `our normal
   rules <#augmented-type-of-usage>`__ for determining the `augmented
   type <#augmented-type>`__ of the bound ``Object``. The only “special”
   part is that we consider the source code ``<T>`` to have a bound of
   ``Object``, just as it does when compiled to bytecode.

Substitution
------------

To substitute each type argument ``Aᵢ`` for each corresponding type
parameter ``Pᵢ``:

For every type ``V`` whose `base
type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
is ``Pᵢ``, replace ``V`` with the `union <#unioning>`__ of ``Aᵢ`` and
the `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ of ``V``.

.. _null-types:

Augmented null types
--------------------

The JLS refers to “the null type.” In this spec, we assign an
`additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ to all types, including
the null type. This produces multiple null types:

-  the null `base
   type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
   with additional nullness ``NO_CHANGE``: the “bottom”/“nothing” type
   used in `capture conversion <#capture-conversion>`__

      No value, including ``null`` itself, has this type.

-  the null base type with additional nullness ``UNION_NULL``: the type
   of the null reference

-  the null base type with additional nullness
   ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``

      This may be relevant only in implementation code.

.. _multiple-worlds:

The least convenient world and the most convenient world
--------------------------------------------------------

Some of the rules in this spec come in 2 versions, 1 for “the least
convenient world” and 1 for “the most convenient world.”

Tools may implement either or both versions of the rules.

   Our goal is to allow tools and their users to choose their desired
   level of strictness in the presence of ``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.
   “The least convenient world” usually assumes that types are
   incompatible unless it has enough information to prove they are
   compatible; “the most convenient world” assumes that types are
   compatible unless it has enough information to prove they are
   incompatible.

   Thus, strict tools may want to implement the least-convenient-world
   version of rules, and lenient tools may wish to implement the
   most-convenient-world version. Or a tool might implement both and let
   users select which rules to apply.

   Another possibility is for a tool to implement both versions and to
   use that to distinguish between “errors” and “warnings.” Such a tool
   might run each check first in the least convenient world and then, if
   the check fails, run it again in the most convenient world. If the
   check fails in both worlds, the tool would produce an error. If it
   passes only because of the most convenient interpretation, the tool
   would produce a warning.

The main body of each section describes the *least*-convenient-world
rule. If the most-convenient-world rule differs, the differences are
explained at the end.

.. _propagating-multiple-worlds:

Propagating the most/least convenient world
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When one rule in this spec refers to another, it refers to the rule for
the same “world.” For example, when the rules for
`containment <#containment>`__ refer to the rules for
`subtyping <#subtyping>`__, the most-convenient-world containment check
applies the most-convenient-world subtyping check, and the
least-convenient-world containment check applies the
least-convenient-world subtyping check.

This applies even if a rule says it is the same for both worlds: It
means “the same except that any other rules are applied in the
corresponding world.”

Same type
---------

``S`` and ``T`` are the same type if ``S`` is a `subtype <#subtyping>`__
of ``T`` and ``T`` is a subtype of ``S``.

Subtyping
---------

``A`` is a subtype of ``F`` if both of the following conditions are met:

-  ``A`` is a subtype of ``F`` according to the `nullness-delegating
   subtyping rules for Java <#nullness-delegating-subtyping>`__.
-  ``A`` is a `nullness subtype <#nullness-subtyping>`__ of ``F``.

.. _nullness-delegating-subtyping:

Nullness-delegating subtyping rules for Java
--------------------------------------------

The Java subtyping rules are defined in `JLS
4.10 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.10>`__.
We add to them as follows:

-  `As always <#concept-references>`__, interpret the Java rules as
   operating on `augmented types <#augmented-type>`__, not `base
   types <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__.
   However, when applying the Java direct-supertype rules themselves,
   *ignore* the `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ of the
   input types and output types. The augmented types matter only when
   the Java rules refer to *other* rules that are defined in this spec.
   *Those* rules respect the additional nullness of some type components
   – but never the additional nullness of the type component that
   represents the whole input or output type.

      To “ignore” the output’s additional nullness, we recommend
      outputting a value of ``NO_CHANGE``, since that is valid for all
      types, including `intersection types <#intersection-types>`__.

-  When the Java array rules require one type to be a *direct* supertype
   of another, consider the direct supertypes of ``T`` to be *every*
   type that ``T`` is a `subtype <#subtyping>`__ of (as always, applying
   the definition of subtyping in this spec).

Nullness subtyping
------------------

``A`` is a nullness subtype of ``F`` if any of the following conditions
are met:

-  ``F`` is `null-inclusive under every
   parameterization <#null-inclusive-under-every-parameterization>`__.
-  ``A`` is `null-exclusive under every
   parameterization <#null-exclusive-under-every-parameterization>`__.
-  ``A`` has a `nullness-subtype-establishing
   path <#nullness-subtype-establishing-path>`__ to any type whose base
   type is the same as the base type of ``F``.

Nullness subtyping (and thus subtyping itself) is *not* transitive.

(Contrast this with our `nullness-delegating
subtyping <#nullness-delegating-subtyping>`__ rules and
`containment <#containment>`__ rules: Each of those is defined as a
transitive closure. However, technically speaking, `there are cases in
which those should not be transitive,
either <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jspecify-dev/yPnkx_GSb0Q/hLgS_431AQAJ>`__.
Fortunately, this “mostly transitive” behavior is exactly the behavior
that implementations are likely to produce naturally. Maybe someday we
will find a way to specify this fully correctly.)

Null-inclusive under every parameterization
-------------------------------------------

A type is null-inclusive under every parameterization if it meets either
of the following conditions:

-  Its `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ is ``UNION_NULL``.
-  It is an intersection type whose elements all are null-inclusive
   under every parameterization.

**Most convenient world:** The rule is the same except that the
requirement for ``UNION_NULL`` is loosened to “``UNION_NULL`` or
``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.”

Null-exclusive under every parameterization
-------------------------------------------

A type is null-exclusive under every parameterization if it has a
`nullness-subtype-establishing
path <#nullness-subtype-establishing-path>`__ to any augmented class or
array type.

   This rule refers specifically to a “class or array type,” as distinct
   from other types like type variables and intersection types.

Nullness-subtype-establishing path
----------------------------------

``A`` has a nullness-subtype-establishing path to ``F`` if both of the
following hold:

-  ``A`` has `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__
   ``NO_CHANGE``.
-  There is a path from ``A`` to ``F`` through
   `nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype
   edges <#nullness-subtype-establishing-direct-supertype-edges>`__.

**Most convenient world:** The rules are the same except that the
requirement for ``NO_CHANGE`` is loosened to “``NO_CHANGE`` or
``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.”

Nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges
----------------------------------------------------

``T`` has nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges to the
union of the nodes computed by the following 2 rules:

Upper-bound rule:

-  if ``T`` is an augmented intersection type: all the intersection
   type’s elements whose `additional nullness <#additional-nullness>`__
   is ``NO_CHANGE``
-  if ``T`` is an augmented type variable: all the corresponding type
   parameter’s upper bounds whose additional nullness is ``NO_CHANGE``
-  otherwise: no nodes

Lower-bound rule:

-  for every type parameter ``P`` that has a lower bound whose `base
   type <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQrBxwaVIPIac_6SCf--w-vZBeHkTvtaqPSU_icIccc/edit#bookmark=kix.k81vs7t5p45i>`__
   is the same as ``T``\ ’s base type and whose additional nullness is
   ``NO_CHANGE``: the type variable ``P``
-  otherwise: no nodes

**Most convenient world:** The rules are the same except that the
requirements for ``NO_CHANGE`` are loosened to “``NO_CHANGE`` or
``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.”

Containment
-----------

The Java rules are defined in `JLS
4.5.1 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.5.1>`__.
We add to them as follows:

-  Disregard the 2 rules that refer to a bare ``?``. Instead, treat
   ``?`` like ``? extends Object``, where the `additional
   nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ of the ``Object`` bound is
   specified by `“Bound of an unbounded
   wildcard.” <#unbounded-wildcard>`__

      This is just a part of our universal rule to treat a bare ``?``
      like ``? extends Object``.

-  The rule written specifically for ``? extends Object`` applies only
   if the additional nullness of the ``Object`` bound is ``UNION_NULL``.

-  When the JLS refers to the same type ``T`` on both sides of a rule,
   the rule applies if and only if this spec defines the 2 types to be
   the `same type <#same-type>`__.

**Most convenient world:** The rules are the same except that the
requirement for ``UNION_NULL`` is loosened to “``UNION_NULL`` or
``CODE_NOT_NULLNESS_AWARE``.”

Capture conversion
------------------

The Java rules are defined in `JLS
5.1.10 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.10>`__.
We add to them as follows:

-  The output type of the conversion has the same `additional
   nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ as the input type.

-  Disregard the JLS rule about ``<?>``. Instead, treat ``?`` like
   ``? extends Object``, where the `additional
   nullness <#additional-nullness>`__ of the ``Object`` bound is
   specified by `“Bound of an unbounded
   wildcard.” <#unbounded-wildcard>`__

      This is just a part of our universal rule to treat a bare ``?``
      like ``? extends Object``.

-  When a rule generates a lower bound that is the null type, we specify
   that its additional nullness is ``NO_CHANGE``. (See `“Augmented null
   types.” <#null-types>`__)
